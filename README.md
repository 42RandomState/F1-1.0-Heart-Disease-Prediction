**ATTENTION**: This notebook does not have a dataset because it is very heavy, visit my kaggle profile to see them  
Machine learning project  
I trained a machine learning model to predict heart disease, with excellent results (F1 score of 1.0).  
If you're interested, feel free to explore the code. Thank you for visiting!
